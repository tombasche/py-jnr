Python JSON-RPC Implementation to play games using [merknera](https://github.com/mleonard87/merknera)

Run from the command line using python server.py "game name" for example:

`python server.py tictactoe`

Incidentally, this is the only game which currently works. All config is in data/tictactoe.xml

Required packages:

* json-rpc
* werkzeug
